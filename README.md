# **IMS**
> ## This is a inventory Management System made by integrating Python and JSON for successfull accomplishment of Assignment-1 for 'Python for AI/ML Internship' by Elite Techno Groups under Skill India.

### **JSON**
> JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is easy for humans to read and write. It is easy for machines to parse and generate. It is based on a subset of the JavaScript Programming Language Standard ECMA-262 3rd Edition - December 1999. JSON is a text format that is completely language independent but uses conventions that are familiar to programmers of the C-family of languages, including C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, Python, and many others. These properties make JSON an ideal data-interchange language.
